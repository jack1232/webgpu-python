# WebGPU in Python 



*wgpu-py* is a Python implementation of WebGPU - the next generation GPU API, while *pygfx* is a Python rendering engine for WebGPU based on *wgpu-py*. This rendering engine enables the creation of a wide variety of graphics applications in Python. Its high-level abstractions make it easy to begin coding with WebGPU, while also allowing developers to craft custom and optimized rendering solutions. With just a few lines of code, intricate 3D objects can be created, as demonstrated on your screen.

In this YouTube video series, I'll use real-world sample apps to explain the basics of *pygfx* rendering engine, including its structure, geometries, materials, lighting, and cameras. Throughout this series, Iâ€™ll guide you in creating a variety of advanced 3D graphics on the *pygfx* engine, including stunning 3D objects with lighting effects, colormaps, and texture mapping.
