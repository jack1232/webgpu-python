# WebGPU in Python 



*wgpu-py* is a Python implementation of WebGPU - the next generation GPU API, while *pygfx* is a Python rendering engine for WebGPU based on *wgpu-py*. This rendering engine empowers the creation of a diverse range of graphics applications in Python. Its high-level abstractions make it accessible for coding with WebGPU, allowing developers to build customized and optimized rendering solutions.

In this YouTube video series, I'll use real-world sample apps to explore the fundamentals of the *pygfx* rendering engine. Topics covered include its structure, geometries, materials, lighting, and cameras. Throughout this series, Iâ€™ll guide you in crafting various advanced 3D graphics using the *pygfx* engine, showcasing stunning 3D objects with lighting effects, colormaps, and texture mapping.
